They is successfull in their own business which is Ainaa Beauty and I want to become as a young success person like them. They both is husband and wife and people know them as Hafiz Mahamad and Syafiqah Ainaa. I am so proud to both of them because of their success in business and their attitude. They are very good and not arrogant even if they are successfull in the world of business. Many things that amaze me with their attitude. for example they even though they have succeeded but never forget their friends who have not succeded. they provide a comfortable and suitable job for their friends to build mutual success </p>
