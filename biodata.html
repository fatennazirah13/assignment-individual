<p style="font-family: Franklin Gothic book; font-size: 18px; text-align: center"> This is my Idola. They is successfull in their own business which is Ainaa Beauty and I want to become as a young success person like them. They both is husband and wife and people know them as Hafiz Mahamad and Syafiqah Ainaa. I am so proud to both of them because of their success in business and their attitude. They are very good and humble person, even they are successfull businessman/businesswomen in the world of business but they always help people, give motivation, always visit and donate to orphanages and make a program which is Ainaa Fantasy to help people in skin problem to help people who have skin problem and help them to have a heathiers skin. Ainaa Fantasy consist of 5 participate who have skin problems. Hafiz and Ainaa is good person to make as a idol because they have a very good attitude. Many things that amaze me with their attitude. for example they even though they have succeeded but never forget their friends who have not succeded. they provide a comfortable and suitable job for their friends to build mutual success. So for me I want to be like them, to success in young, to help many people and become humble person in where ever I am. </p>
