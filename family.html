<p style="font-family: Franklin Gothic book; font-size: 18px; text-align: center">This is our family day. Many laugh we make together on that day even it is only a small family day program that we only make it at village at grandmother house beacause of my grandfather condition and his health in not good to go far like at a beach. On that day we did many activities such as cycling, basketball, taking photo, playing badminton, watching horror movie togethers and more. I like to gathering like this with my family because it so fun and we can make a lot of laugh with share story together, play together, eat together, selfie together and more. What important is we feel never tired when we are together.
