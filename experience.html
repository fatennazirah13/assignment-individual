<p style="font-family: Franklin Gothic book; font-size: 18px; text-align: center; background-color: lightyellow"> For 20 years of my life, many things I have experienced such as hardship and hapiness but all of these are patterns in my life that can make me think about life is not always beautiful and is not always difficult. I need to strengthen one's spirit. Experience in working honestly I only have a bit. I have opened a small stall in front of my house to do business like burger, grilled sausages and various type of water. This stall was opened by me after I finished the SPM 2017 with a capitalof RM200 given by my lovely Mama. This idea was also given by Mama because Mama did not want to see me not doing anything at home so I did business until I got an offer to go to UiTM Machang for future my study in Diploma in Information Management. For the business I got not too much but Alhamdullilah with the money I can buy a mobile phone before I go to UiTM and can save and use that money for buy a few necessities to go to UiTM without burden my parent. From the business I actually learned a lot of things to manage money, I can learned and be discipline in manage time because before this after Subuh I will continues sleep but when doing business I need to open a shop. Beside that I learn how to be patient, I learn the meaning of how hard to get money. There are many things I can learned from doing business, that's why Mama gave me idea to open a stall for doing small business while waiting to continues my study. The experience way very valuable and hard for me to forget.</p>
